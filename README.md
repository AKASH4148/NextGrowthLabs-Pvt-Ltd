I'm a little nervous to inform you that unfortunately, I couldn't make it possible to complete all the tasks in the given time. Deadline was pretty enough to solve such kind of problem's solution but whatever assigned problems i got to solve that was pretty new i found, it's almost based on transfer learning and natural language processing what i'm just learning now but these  assigned tasks helped a lot to learn the new techniques of transfer learnings and NLP..<br>
I developed the models of Part1 problems statement and the Part2 problems, but i found both dataset available without  labels so i got confused over there but i tried to find the solution using some techniques but i had to face some packages error and in few one not expected output.  Honestly, I experienced the sentiment analysis kind of problem so well and was able to solve it easily but here I have to learn a lot to figure out the solution, It's not much difficult but I think I was having this with less knowledge.<br>

I would like to mention the task  below that I completed. Maybe this tells me I was on the right path or not but it's incomplete.<br>

PART 1: <br>
      1) COMPLETED- 100%<br>
      2) INCOMPLETE - 70 Percent completed but i got error to so 30 percent not, Deployment is easy but failed to make model.<br>
      3) Incomplete - 100 %<br>
      
PART 2: <br>
      1) Incomplete - 80 % completed but failed to get expected outcome<>
      2) Honestly, failed to solve.<br>
